    The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again.

    Channelers are individuals who have the ability to manipulate the One Power, the fundamental force of creation within the series' universe. The One Power is divided into two halves: saidin, the male half, and saidar, the female half. Channelers who can wield saidin are usually male, while those who can wield saidar are usually female.
