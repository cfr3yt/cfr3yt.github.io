Channelers are individuals who have the ability to manipulate the One Power, the fundamental force of creation within the series' universe. The One Power is divided into two halves: saidin, the male half, and saidar, the female half. Channelers who can wield saidin are usually male, while those who can wield saidar are usually female.
