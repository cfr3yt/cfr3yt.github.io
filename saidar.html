  The True Source is divided into a male half, saidin, and a female half, saidar. Only women can touch and use saidar and only men are capable of using saidin. The ways that the two halves weave the One Power are so different that men cannot teach women nor can women teach men. However the same basic rules for using them apply to each equally.
